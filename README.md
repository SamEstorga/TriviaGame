# Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia Trivia Game
  I made a simple trivia game that was focusing on the use of timers. Its a fun multiple choice quiz that asked you Its Always Sunny trivia questions. There is a timer indicating how much time you have to finish the quiz. When you answer all of the questions or when the timer runs out the page will show you how many questions you got correct, missed and didn't answer. I really enjoyed the theme I chose for this assignment.
